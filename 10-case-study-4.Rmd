# Data Wrangling

The data used in this document is from [Kaggle's US Election 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/unanimad/us-election-2020?select=president_county_candidate.csv).

```{r}
presidential_elections_2020 <- read_csv("data/president_county_candidate.csv")
```

# Data Exploration

```{r}
# count the total number of votes each candidate got
# start with presidential_elections_2020 and then group by candidate and 
# summarize the sum of total_votes (3:13pm) add kable() to make your table look nice
# and maybe arrange() to order candidates
presidential_elections_2020 %>%
  group_by(candidate) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(total_votes)) %>%
  arrange(-total) %>%
  kable(col.names = c("Candidate", "Total Votes"),
        format.args = list(big.mark = ","))

```
